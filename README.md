# Exploring Theory With Code
Short notebooks experimenting with Linear Algebra & Statistics.

<p align="left">
 Parallel to my Masters in Data Analytics, I am also targetting key areas of skill development to supplement the degree. In particular at the momemnt I am working to improve my Python code by applying what I find interesting from a side course in Linear Algebra for Data Science and Machine Learning. The notebooks here are a documentation of my own curiosity; it is my aim to structure these docs to be of use to another reader.
